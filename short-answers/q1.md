# Question
`replaceAll` is a handy new function that will match all instances of a given pattern. But what is the regex that will allow `replace` to get *all* instances of a pattern?

# Answer
To get all instances of a pattern, we would have to add the `/g` flag (and possibly the `/i` flag depending on the question). `/g` is the global flag that will ensure that all of the patterns are matched, not just the first one (which would occur if `/g` is not added to the regex expression).
