# Question
Why would you want to use a `\b` character class instead of a `\s` character class?

# Answer
`\b` and `\s` serves different purposes. 

`\b` doesn't match any actual character but rather position within the string. It is a word boundary anchor and matches a position where one side is a word character (letter, digit, underscore, etc) and the other side is not a word character, or vice versa.

`\s` matches any whitespace character, including spaces, tabs, and line breaks. 

We would use `\b` when we want to match word boundaries, like the beginning or end of words. `\b` would match the words directly and not if it was part of a longer word. For example, `\bmarcy\b` would only match the word "marcy" and not "marcyFellows." 

We would use `\s` when we want to match any whitespace character.
