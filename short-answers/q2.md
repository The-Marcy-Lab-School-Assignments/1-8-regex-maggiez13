# Question
What's an example of when RegEx would solve a problem that would be difficult to solve with other tools?

# Answer
As RegEx is used for pattern matching for strings and string manipulation, it would solve the problems of the telephone number and email on the homework easier compared to other tools. Without RegEx, we would have to create a for loop and look through each individual character of the email to determine if it is or is not considered to be part of a correctly formatted email.
